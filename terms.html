We will not be liable if, for any reason, our Site or our Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. We reserve access to deactivate your account at any time.
                Due to the nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee continued and uninterrupted availability and accessibility to the iKowapiApp platform. We may restrict the availability of the platform or of certain areas or features thereof if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the app. iKowapiApp may improve, 
                enhance and modify the platform and introduce new services from time to time, at our discretion.
                iKowapiApp will not be liable for any errors, delays or anomalies in our Site and Service that may arise and which may be due to third-party issues (such as, but not limited to, network, hardware or provider issues), force majeure or fortuitous events or any other contingencies of a totally unpredictable nature and thus unrelated to the good will of the business.
