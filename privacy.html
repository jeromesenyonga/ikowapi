                    Personal information or data, as described in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, is any information relating to an identified or 
                    identifiable natural person—identifiable particularly by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his/her physical, psychological, mental, economic or social identity.
                </p><br>
                <h3 class="title-align">1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
                <p class="lead word">We may collect and store the following types of information—
                </p>
                <h5 class="title-align">1.1 Information you provide</h5>
                <p class="lead word">Information submitted when you register with iKowapiApp. Please remember that iKowapiApp offers two different types of services, 
                    wherein the user can choose to use the App in his/her capacity as a “host” or a “Guest”. Depending on which role you are carrying out, more or less personal information may be required of you, to ensure all our users can enjoy the App’s services safely and securely.
                <p class="failure"><b>The Guest’s personal information</b></p>
                <p class="lead word">The Guest will only be asked by iKowapiApp to provide an email address, telephone number, username and password. However, when a Guest is accepted in a iKowapi, the payment gateway inside the App (operated by a third-party Electronic Money Institution) will require he/she enter their credit card information.
                 Depending on the applicable law in each country, the billing address may also be required. iKowapiApp does not store this information, and has no immediate access to it.
                </p>
                <p class="failure"><b>The host personal information</b></p>
                <p class="lead word">Someone wishing to act as a host will have to provide an email a telephone number, his/her address and password. In order to receive the shared costs of a iKowapi, they will also have to enter bank details into the payment gateway, such as email (for PayPal or similar) or bank accounts, billing addresses, etc. Again, 
                iKowapiApp does not store this information, and has no immediate access to it, as the Electronic Money Institution facilitating in-App transactions is a specialised third-party.
                </p>
                </p>
                <h5 class="title-align">1.2 Information collected through use of the App</h5>
                <p class="lead word">During your use of the App, we may use a variety of technologies that collect information about how the app is being utilised. This includes—
                <p class="failure"><b>Transactions information</b></p>
                <p class="lead word">
                    iKowapiApp may collect information about your type of interaction with the App—for instance, whether you use it as a host, guest or both. Transaction information also includes information regarding certain general details of the iKowapis, including things such as date, duration, amount charged, and approximate location.
                </p>
                <p class="failure"><b>Technical data</b></p>
                <p class="lead word">
                    This regards information on the type of device your are using to access the App, including the hardware models, operating systems, application version, network connection type, software, provider, preferred language, unique device identifiers and device motion information.
                </p>
                </p>
                <h5 class="title-align">1.3 Special permission</h5>
                <p class="lead word">The App may require access to certain services on your mobile device, which will have to be approved by you beforehand, such as the following—
                    <p class="failure"><b>Location information</b></p>
                    <p class="lead word">
                        You will be required to have your geo-location activated in your mobile device so that the app may collect your precise or approximate location (depending on whether you are connected to WiFi, 4G, etc). This information will be viewed by other users in real-time. 
                        iKowapiApp will collect location information when the app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on screen) of your device.
                    </p>
                    <p class="failure"><b>Camera</b></p>
                    <p class="lead word">
                        You will need to grant iKowapiApp access to your device’s camera in order to take pictures, videos or any other form of supported. However, any pictures, 
                        videos or any other supported form of multimedia taken inside the App will not be uploaded onto any user’s personal photo library and will instead be kept inside the App.
                    </p>
                </p>
                <h5 class="title-align">1.4 Information from other sources</h5>
                <p class="lead word">iKowapiApp may receive and collect information from other sources, such as—

                    <p class="failure">Partners through which you access your account, such as payment providers.
                    </p>
                </p>
                <h3 class="title-align">2. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

                 thus is formatted to remember previously provided information so that the user will not have to re-enter it each time he/she wishes to use the service (for instance, login details, which will not have to be introduced every time you use the App so long as you are not logged out).
                </p>
                <h5 class="title-align">2.2 Customer support</h5>
                <p class="lead word">We also hope to maintain a fluid communication channel with the user for service-related or research purposes, via emails, notifications, text messages or others, always dependent upon the user’s consent. 
                All the information we have gathered or are provided with will be used by customer support to swiftly resolve any issues that may have arisen during the course of a iKowapi, and appropriate action will be taken.
                </p>
                <h5 class="title-align">2.3 Safety & Security</h5>
                <p class="lead word">iKowapiApp uses your data to monitor the use of the App and to ensure interactions are being carried out safely and correctly. For instance, iKowapiApp will have to provide the App with all the information necessary to ensure that, 
                if they are not carrying out their iKowapi in accordance with our Terms and Conditions, the User can promptly identify him/her and launch a complaint. This also helps make sure that the host using the App matches the iKowapiApp account we have on file, preventing fraud and guaranteeing other users’ protection.
                </p>
                <h5 class="title-align">2.4 Research & Development</h5>
                <p class="lead word">iKowapiApp may use the information to develop and test new products and features, as well as automatically update the App on your device (if the user allows it to be so) and diagnose and fix technical problems.
                We are also able to monitor metrics such as demographic patterns, trends of usage, traffic and preferences, among others, in order to better our services.
                </p>
                <h5 class="title-align">2.5 Communication from ikowapi App</h5>

                <h5 class="title-align">2.7 Legal proceedings</h5>
                <p class="lead word">The information collected may be used to investigate claims or disputes arising from the use of the App, or as otherwise allowed by the applicable law.
                </p>
                <h3 class="title-align">3. HOW WE PROTECT OUR INFORMATION</h3>
                <p class="lead word">Protecting our user’s information is a priority, and iKowapiApp takes a range of measures to ensure it. We implement a variety of security measures during your use of our Site and/or Service to maintain the safety of your personal information.
